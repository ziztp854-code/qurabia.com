"""jspace — an instrument for the J-Space skill.

It knows one thing you cannot know accurately: what state you were in a few seams
ago. It keeps that record and hands it back. It decides nothing, and it blocks
nothing.

Exit codes mean one thing only:

    0   it did what you asked
    2   it could not do what you asked

It never exits non-zero to stop you from working. The one thing it declines to do
is write a malformed entry into the ledger, because a ledger you cannot trust is
worse than no ledger — it looks like state.
